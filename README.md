# Mobile Home Park Model

This project is a Create React App that models the operations of a mobile home park. It now includes Supabase-backed authentication and persistence so users can sign in, save their underwriting reports, and reload them later.

The app is deployed as a static React site and uses the `api/save-report.js` serverless function when running on Vercel.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- A Supabase project (Database + Authentication enabled)
- Optional: Resend account for notification emails
- Optional: OpenAI account for text embeddings
- [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) if you plan to preview locally with the Vercel runtime

## Environment variables

| Location | Variable | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| React app | `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |
| React app | `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anon/public API key |
| Vercel function | `SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |
| Vercel function | `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Supabase service role key (keep private) |
| Vercel function | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Optional, required to generate embeddings when saving reports |
| Vercel function | `RESEND_API_KEY` | Optional, required to send notification emails when reports are saved |
| Vercel function | `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` | Optional, verified sender address for Resend notification emails |
| Vercel function | `REPORT_NOTIFICATION_EMAILS` | Optional, comma-separated list of email recipients notified on save |

Create two `.env` files:

```bash
# React app runtime
cp .env.example .env.local   # create this file if it doesn't exist

# Vercel serverless runtime
cp .env.server.example .env  # create this file if it doesn't exist
```

Populate them with the variables from the table above. For CRA, any variables that need to be exposed to the browser must be prefixed with `REACT_APP_`.

> **Security note:** Never commit `.env*` files. Vercel manages environment variables securely via the dashboard or CLI.

### Email notifications

With `RESEND_API_KEY` and `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` configured the `/api/save-report` function emails a copy of every saved or updated report. Recipients come from the optional `REPORT_NOTIFICATION_EMAILS` list (comma-separated) and the report contact's email address when available. Leave these values blank to disable email delivery while still allowing Supabase persistence.

## Supabase database setup

Create a `reports` table that can store the generated HTML along with any of the optional metadata you want to persist. The API works best when the table includes a `report_html` column, but it will still persist the structured JSON state even if that field is absent (a warning will be logged and returned to the client). The following SQL creates a compatible schema you can paste into the Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
create table if not exists public.reports (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users (id),
  report_name text,
  report_state jsonb,
  user_name text,
  user_email text,
  user_phone text,
  user_company text,
  park_name text,
  park_address text,
  park_city text,
  park_state text,
  purchase_price numeric,
  closing_costs numeric,
  total_investment numeric,
  down_payment_percent numeric,
  down_payment_amount numeric,
  loan_amount numeric,
  interest_rate numeric,
  loan_term_years numeric,
  monthly_payment numeric,
  annual_debt_service numeric,
  total_lots integer,
  occupied_lots integer,
  physical_occupancy numeric,
  economic_occupancy numeric,
  gross_potential_rent numeric,
  lot_rent_income numeric,
  other_income numeric,
  effective_gross_income numeric,
  total_operating_expenses numeric,
  management_fee numeric,
  noi numeric,
  cap_rate numeric,
  cash_on_cash numeric,
  dscr numeric,
  irr numeric,
  equity_multiple numeric,
  annual_cash_flow numeric,
  income_per_unit numeric,
  expense_per_unit numeric,
  noi_per_unit numeric,
  report_html text not null,
  rent_roll jsonb,
  income_items jsonb,
  expense_items jsonb,
  additional_income jsonb,
  embedding jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  updated_at timestamptz default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);

create index if not exists reports_user_id_idx on public.reports (user_id);

create trigger handle_reports_updated_at
  before update on public.reports
  for each row
  execute function public.handle_updated_at();
```

> The `handle_updated_at` trigger is created automatically in new Supabase projects. If it does not exist, create it with:
>
> ```sql
> create function public.handle_updated_at()
> returns trigger
> language plpgsql
> as $$
> begin
>   new.updated_at = timezone('utc'::text, now());
>   return new;
> end;
> $$;
> ```

If you already have a `reports` table, make sure it includes a `report_html` column (type `text` or `jsonb`) and that any JSON fields such as `report_state`, `rent_roll`, or `additional_income` use the `jsonb` type. When the column is missing the serverless API still saves reports (omitting the raw HTML) and surfaces a warning so you can add it later. The API continues to validate the schema and returns descriptive errors when the table itself is missing or inaccessible.

## Local development

Install dependencies and start the CRA development server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Authentication and report saving will function locally as long as the Supabase environment variables are set.

## Local testing with the Vercel runtime

To simulate production behaviour (including the `/api/save-report` function) install the Vercel CLI and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
vercel dev
```

`vercel dev` reads environment variables from `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.development.local`, etc. You can sync variables from your Vercel project with:

```bash
vercel login
vercel link
vercel env pull .env.local
```

Then restart `vercel dev` so both the React app and the API route run under the same environment.

## Running tests

```bash
npm test
```

This launches the CRA test runner in watch mode.

## Production build

Build the static React bundle that Vercel will serve:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output lives in `build/`. Push your branch and open a PR to trigger a Vercel preview deployment. You can test the Supabase-powered flows in the preview URL once the environment variables are set in the Vercel dashboard.

## Deploying to Vercel

Once you are satisfied with your changes locally:

1. Commit the changes to your git branch.
2. Push the branch to GitHub (or your connected Git provider). For example:

   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

3. Vercel automatically detects the push, builds the project, and publishes a new deployment for that branch. You can monitor the progress from the Vercel dashboard or the Git provider's pull request view.

If you are merging to the production branch (commonly `main`), Vercel will promote the resulting deployment to your production URL once the build succeeds.

## Troubleshooting

- **Supabase not configured:** The UI will warn you if `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL` or `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are missing. Ensure they are present in `.env.local` before running locally or configure them in Vercel > Project Settings > Environment Variables.
- **Report saves fail:** Check the serverless logs (`vercel logs <deployment-url>`) to confirm the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is available. The API now surfaces descriptive errors when credentials, the `reports` table, or the `report_html` column are missing. The browser alert will include the server message for quick debugging.
- **Emails/embeddings skipped:** The serverless function logs warnings if `RESEND_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` are not defined. These features are optional.
